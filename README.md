This repository contains Helm Charts and documentation for 3rd-party projects. We use Helm to manage our Kubernetes manifest files, for more information about installing and using Helm, see its [README.md](https://github.com/helm/helm/tree/master/README.md). To get a quick introduction to Charts see this [chart document](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/charts.md).
